"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/tls: Fix use-after-free after the TLS device goes down and up

When a netdev with active TLS offload goes down, tls_device_down is
called to stop the offload and tear down the TLS context. However, the
socket stays alive, and it still points to the TLS context, which is now
deallocated. If a netdev goes up, while the connection is still active,
and the data flow resumes after a number of TCP retransmissions, it will
lead to a use-after-free of the TLS context.

This commit addresses this bug by keeping the context alive until its
normal destruction, and implements the necessary fallbacks, so that the
connection can resume in software (non-offloaded) kTLS mode.

On the TX side tls_sw_fallback is used to encrypt all packets. The RX
side already has all the necessary fallbacks, because receiving
non-decrypted packets is supported. The thing needed on the RX side is
to block resync requests, which are normally produced after receiving
non-decrypted packets.

The necessary synchronization is implemented for a graceful teardown:
first the fallbacks are deployed, then the driver resources are released
(it used to be possible to have a tls_dev_resync after tls_dev_del).

A new flag called TLS_RX_DEV_DEGRADED is added to indicate the fallback
mode. It's used to skip the RX resync logic completely, as it becomes
useless, and some objects may be released (for example, resync_async,
which is allocated and freed by the driver)."	"You are a cybersecurity expert specializing in cyber threat intelligence. Analyze the following CVE

An issue was discovered on Renesas SmartBond DA14691, DA14695, DA14697, and DA14699 devices. The Nonce used for on-the-fly decryption of flash images is stored in an unsigned header, allowing its value to be modified without invalidating the signature used for secureboot image verification. Because the encryption engine for on-the-fly decryption uses AES in CTR mode without authentication, an attacker-modified Nonce can result in execution of arbitrary code.

Authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. There is a bug in our implementation of PKCE that allows an attacker to circumvent the protection that PKCE offers. PKCE adds the code_challenge parameter to the authorization request and adds the code_verifier parameter to the token request. Prior to 2023.8.7 and 2023.10.7, a downgrade scenario is possible: if the attacker removes the code_challenge parameter from the authorization request, authentik will not do the PKCE check. Because of this bug, an attacker can circumvent the protection PKCE offers, such as CSRF attacks and code injection attacks.  Versions 2023.8.7 and 2023.10.7 fix the issue.

"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix deadlock with fiemap and extent locking

While working on the patchset to remove extent locking I got a lockdep
splat with fiemap and pagefaulting with my new extent lock replacement
lock.

This deadlock exists with our normal code, we just don't have lockdep
annotations with the extent locking so we've never noticed it.

Since we're copying the fiemap extent to user space on every iteration
we have the chance of pagefaulting.  Because we hold the extent lock for
the entire range we could mkwrite into a range in the file that we have
mmap'ed.  This would deadlock with the following stack trace

I wrote an fstest to reproduce this deadlock without my replacement lock
and verified that the deadlock exists with our existing locking.

To fix this simply don't take the extent lock for the entire duration of
the fiemap.  This is safe in general because we keep track of where we
are when we're searching the tree, so if an ordered extent updates in
the middle of our fiemap call we'll still emit the correct extents
because we know what offset we were on before.

The only place we maintain the lock is searching delalloc.  Since the
delalloc stuff can change during writeback we want to lock the extent
range so we have a consistent view of delalloc at the time we're
checking to see if we need to set the delalloc flag.

With this patch applied we no longer deadlock with my testcase."	"You are a cybersecurity expert specializing in cyber threat intelligence. Analyze the following CVE

trunk.cocoapods.org is the authentication server for the CoacoaPods dependency manager. Prior to commit d4fa66f49cedab449af9a56a21ab40697b9f7b97, the trunk sessions verification step could be manipulated for owner session hijacking Compromising a victim’s session will result in a full takeover of the CocoaPods trunk account. The threat actor could manipulate their pod specifications, disrupt the distribution of legitimate libraries, or cause widespread disruption within the CocoaPods ecosystem. This was patched server-side with commit d4fa66f49cedab449af9a56a21ab40697b9f7b97 in October 2023.	"You are a cybersecurity expert specializing in cyber threat intelligence.

"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/i915: Fix potential context UAFs

gem_context_register() makes the context visible to userspace, and which
point a separate thread can trigger the I915_GEM_CONTEXT_DESTROY ioctl.
So we need to ensure that nothing uses the ctx ptr after this.  And we

RIOT is an open-source microcontroller operating system, designed to match the requirements of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and other embedded devices. A malicious actor can send a IEEE 802.15.4 packet with spoofed length byte and optionally spoofed FCS, which eventually results into an endless loop on a CC2538 as receiver. Before PR #20998, the receiver would check for the location of the CRC bit using the packet length byte by considering all 8 bits, instead of discarding bit 7, which is what the radio does. This then results into reading outside of the RX FIFO.  Although it prints an error when attempting to read outside of the RX FIFO, it will continue doing this. This may lead to a discrepancy in the CRC check according to the firmware and the radio. If the CPU judges the CRC as correct and the radio is set to `AUTO_ACK`, when the packet requests and acknowledgment the CPU will go into the state `CC2538_STATE_TX_ACK`. However, if the radio judged the CRC as incorrect, it will not send an acknowledgment, and thus the `TXACKDONE` event will not fire. It will then never return to the state `CC2538_STATE_READY` since the baseband processing is still disabled. Then the CPU will be in an endless loop. Since setting to idle is not forced, it won't do it if the radio's state is not `CC2538_STATE_READY`. A fix has not yet been made.

If the CPU judges the CRC as correct and the radio is set to `AUTO_ACK`, when the packet requests and acknowledgment the CPU will go into the state `CC2538_STATE_TX_ACK`. However, if the radio judged the CRC as incorrect, it will not send an acknowledgment, and thus the `TXACKDONE` event will not fire. It will then never return to the state `CC2538_STATE_READY` since the baseband processing is still disabled. Then the CPU will be in an endless loop. Since setting to idle is not forced, it won't do it if the radio's state is not `CC2538_STATE_READY`. A fix has not yet been made."	CWE-835

RestSharp is a Simple REST and HTTP API Client for .NET. The second argument to `RestRequest.AddHeader` (the header value) is vulnerable to CRLF injection. The same applies to `RestRequest.AddOrUpdateHeader` and `RestClient.AddDefaultHeader`. The way HTTP headers are added to a request is via the `HttpHeaders.TryAddWithoutValidation` method which does not check for CRLF characters in the header value. This means that any headers from a `RestSharp.RequestHeaders` object are added to the request in such a way that they are vulnerable to CRLF-injection. In general, CRLF-injection into a HTTP header (when using HTTP/1.1) means that one can inject additional HTTP headers or smuggle whole HTTP requests. If an application using the RestSharp library passes a user-controllable value through to a header, then that application becomes vulnerable to CRLF-injection. This is not necessarily a security issue for a command line application like the one above, but if such code were present in a web application then it becomes vulnerable to request splitting (as shown in the PoC) and thus Server Side Request Forgery. Strictly speaking this is a potential vulnerability in applications using RestSharp, not in RestSharp itself, but I would argue that at the very least there needs to be a warning about this behaviour in the RestSharp documentation. RestSharp has addressed this issue in version 112.0.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. A stack-buffer overflow has been detected in the `vorbis_handle_identification_packet` function within `gstvorbisdec.c`. The position array is a stack-allocated buffer of size 64. If vd->vi.channels exceeds 64, the for loop will write beyond the boundaries of the position array. The value written will always be `GST_AUDIO_CHANNEL_POSITION_NONE`. This vulnerability allows someone to overwrite the EIP address allocated in the stack.

"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

kprobes: Fix possible use-after-free issue on kprobe registration

When unloading a module, its state is changing MODULE_STATE_LIVE ->
 MODULE_STATE_GOING -> MODULE_STATE_UNFORMED. Each change will take
a time. `is_module_text_address()` and `__module_text_address()`
works with MODULE_STATE_LIVE and MODULE_STATE_GOING.
If we use `is_module_text_address()` and `__module_text_address()`
separately, there is a chance that the first one is succeeded but the
next one is failed because module->state becomes MODULE_STATE_UNFORMED
between those operations.

In `check_kprobe_address_safe()`, if the second `__module_text_address()`
is failed, that is ignored because it expected a kernel_text address.
But it may have failed simply because module->state has been changed
to MODULE_STATE_UNFORMED. In this case, arm_kprobe() will try to modify
non-exist module text address (use-after-free).

To fix this problem, we should not use separated `is_module_text_address()`

"AshPostgres is the PostgreSQL data layer for Ash Framework. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.4.10, in certain very specific situations, it was possible for the policies of an update action to be skipped. This occurred only on ""empty"" update actions (no changing fields), and would allow their hooks (side effects) to be performed when they should not have been. Note that this does not allow reading new data that the user should not have had access to, only triggering a side effect a user should not have been able to trigger.

To be vulnerable, an affected user must have an update action that is on a resource with no attributes containing an ""update default"" (updated_at timestamp, for example); can be performed atomically; does not have `require_atomic? false`; has at least one authorizer (typically `Ash.Policy.Authorizer`); and has at least one `change` (on the resource's `changes` block or in the action itself). This is where the side-effects would be performed when they should not have been.

This problem has been patched in `2.4.10` of `ash_postgres`. Several workarounds are available. Potentially affected users may determine that none of their actions are vulnerable using a script the maintainers provide in the GitHub Security Advisory, add `require_atomic? false` to any potentially affected update action, replace any usage of `Ash.update` with `Ash.bulk_update` for an affected action, and/or add an update timestamp to their action."

A command injection vulnerability exists in the gradio-app/gradio repository, specifically within the 'test-functional.yml' workflow. The vulnerability arises due to improper neutralization of special elements used in a command, allowing for unauthorized modification of the base repository or secrets exfiltration. The issue affects versions up to and including '@gradio/video@0.6.12'. The flaw is present in the workflow's handling of GitHub context information, where it echoes the full name of the head repository, the head branch, and the workflow reference without adequate sanitization. This could potentially lead to the exfiltration of sensitive secrets such as 'GITHUB_TOKEN', 'COMMENT_TOKEN', and 'CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN'.

DISPUTE NOTE: this issue does not pose a security risk as it (according to analysis by the original software developer, NLnet Labs) falls within the expected functionality and security controls of the application. Red Hat has made a claim that there is a security risk within Red Hat products. NLnet Labs has no further information about the claim, and suggests that affected Red Hat customers refer to available Red Hat documentation or support channels. ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION: A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the ub_ctx_set_fwd function in Unbound. This issue could allow an attacker who can invoke specific sequences of API calls to cause a segmentation fault. When certain API functions such as ub_ctx_set_fwd and ub_ctx_resolvconf are called in a particular order, the program attempts to read from a NULL pointer, leading to a crash. This issue can result in a denial of service by causing the application to terminate unexpectedly.	"You are a cybersecurity expert specializing in cyber threat intelligence.

"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm-crypt, dm-verity: disable tasklets

Tasklets have an inherent problem with memory corruption. The function
tasklet_action_common calls tasklet_trylock, then it calls the tasklet
callback and then it calls tasklet_unlock. If the tasklet callback frees
the structure that contains the tasklet or if it calls some code that may
free it, tasklet_unlock will write into free memory.

The commits 8e14f610159d and d9a02e016aaf try to fix it for dm-crypt, but
it is not a sufficient fix and the data corruption can still happen [1].
There is no fix for dm-verity and dm-verity will write into free memory
with every tasklet-processed bio.

There will be atomic workqueues implemented in the kernel 6.9 [2]. They
will have better interface and they will not suffer from the memory
corruption problem.

But we need something that stops the memory corruption now and that can be
backported to the stable kernels. So, I'm proposing this commit that
disables tasklets in both dm-crypt and dm-verity. This commit doesn't
remove the tasklet support, because the tasklet code will be reused when
atomic workqueues will be implemented.

"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

IB/core: Implement a limit on UMAD receive List

The existing behavior of ib_umad, which maintains received MAD
packets in an unbounded list, poses a risk of uncontrolled growth.
As user-space applications extract packets from this list, the rate
of extraction may not match the rate of incoming packets, leading
to potential list overflow.

To address this, we introduce a limit to the size of the list. After
considering typical scenarios, such as OpenSM processing, which can
handle approximately 100k packets per second, and the 1-second retry
timeout for most packets, we set the list size limit to 200k. Packets
received beyond this limit are dropped, assuming they are likely timed
out by the time they are handled by user-space.

Notably, packets queued on the receive list due to reasons like
timed-out sends are preserved even when the list is full."	"You are a cybersecurity expert specializing in cyber threat intelligence. Analyze the following CVE

TOTOLINK AC1200 Wireless Router A3002RU V2.1.1-B20230720.1011 is vulnerable to Buffer Overflow. The formWlEncrypt CGI handler in the boa program fails to limit the length of the wlan_ssid field from user input. This allows attackers to craft malicious HTTP requests by supplying an excessively long value for the wlan_ssid field, leading to a stack overflow. This can be further exploited to execute arbitrary commands or launch denial-of-service attacks.	"You are a cybersecurity expert specializing in cyber threat intelligence. Analyze the following CVE

"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: iscsi: Fix conn use after free during resets

If we haven't done a unbind target call we can race where
iscsi_conn_teardown wakes up the EH thread and then frees the conn while
those threads are still accessing the conn ehwait.

We can only do one TMF per session so this just moves the TMF fields from
the conn to the session. We can then rely on the
iscsi_session_teardown->iscsi_remove_session->__iscsi_unbind_session call

"Plate media is an open source, rich-text editor for React. Editors that use `MediaEmbedElement` and pass custom `urlParsers` to the `useMediaState` hook may be vulnerable to XSS if a custom parser allows `javascript:`, `data:` or `vbscript:` URLs to be embedded. Editors that do not use `urlParsers` and consume the `url` property directly may also be vulnerable if the URL is not sanitised. The default parsers `parseTwitterUrl` and `parseVideoUrl` are not affected. `@udecode/plate-media` 36.0.10 resolves this issue by only allowing HTTP and HTTPS URLs during parsing. This affects only the `embed` property returned from `useMediaState`. In addition, the `url` property returned from `useMediaState` has been renamed to `unsafeUrl` to indicate that it has not been sanitised. The `url` property on `element` is also unsafe, but has not been renamed. If you're using either of these properties directly, you will still need to validate the URL yourself. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any custom `urlParsers` do not allow `javascript:`, `data:` or `vbscript:` URLs to be returned in the `url` property of their return values. If `url` is consumed directly, validate the URL protocol before passing it to the `iframe` element.

Continuous receipt of a BGP UPDATE with a specifically malformed path attribute will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition for impacted devices. While this issue affects systems running 32-bit and 64-bit systems, the probability of impact on 64-bit system is extremely low. 
According to  KB25803  https://supportportal.juniper.net/s/article/Junos-How-to-check-if-Junos-OS-is-64-or-32-bit-on-a-router , customers can confirm 32-bit or 64-bit system via the ' show version detail ' command:



     lab@router> show version detail| match 32
     JUNOS 32-bit kernel Software Suite 

     lab@router> show version detail| match 64
     JUNOS 64-bit kernel Software Suite 


This issue affects:

 Juniper Networks Junos OS: 

  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S8, 
  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S4, 
  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S3, 
  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S1,

phpMyFAQ is an Open Source FAQ web application for PHP 8.1+ and MySQL, PostgreSQL and other databases. The 'sharing FAQ' functionality allows any unauthenticated actor to misuse the phpMyFAQ application to send arbitrary emails to a large range of targets. The phpMyFAQ application has a functionality where anyone can share a FAQ item to others. The front-end of this functionality allows any phpMyFAQ articles to be shared with 5 email addresses. Any unauthenticated actor can perform this action. There is a CAPTCHA in place, however the amount of people you email with a single request is not limited to 5 by the backend. An attacker can thus solve a single CAPTCHA and send thousands of emails at once. An attacker can utilize the target application's email server to send phishing messages. This can get the server on a blacklist, causing all emails to end up in spam. It can also lead to reputation damages. This issue has been patched in version 3.2.5.

net: sched: flower: protect fl_walk() with rcu

Patch that refactored fl_walk() to use idr_for_each_entry_continue_ul()
also removed rcu protection of individual filters which causes following
use-after-free when filter is deleted concurrently. Fix fl_walk() to obtain
rcu read lock while iterating and taking the filter reference and temporary
release the lock while calling arg->fn() callback that can sleep.

an I2C transfer triggered from the clock controller clk_ops .prepare

I2C access resumes this I2C bus controller via .runtime_resume callback,
which calls clk_prepare_enable(), which attempts to grab the prepare_lock
mutex again and deadlocks.

Since the clock are already prepared since probe() and unprepared in

disable the clock on runtime suspend and resume, to avoid hitting the
prepare_lock mutex."	"You are a cybersecurity expert specializing in cyber threat intelligence. Analyze the following CVE

"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

binder: fix async_free_space accounting for empty parcels

In 4.13, commit 74310e06be4d (""android: binder: Move buffer out of area shared with user space"")
fixed a kernel structure visibility issue. As part of that patch,
sizeof(void *) was used as the buffer size for 0-length data payloads so
the driver could detect abusive clients sending 0-length asynchronous
transactions to a server by enforcing limits on async_free_size.

Unfortunately, on the ""free"" side, the accounting of async_free_space
did not add the sizeof(void *) back. The result was that up to 8-bytes of
async_free_space were leaked on every async transaction of 8-bytes or
less.  These small transactions are uncommon, so this accounting issue
has gone undetected for several years.

The fix is to use ""buffer_size"" (the allocated buffer size) instead of
""size"" (the logical buffer size) when updating the async_free_space
during the free operation. These are the same except for this
corner case of asynchronous transactions with payloads < 8 bytes."	"You are a cybersecurity expert specializing in cyber threat intelligence. Analyze the following CVE

"ECMA-262 is the language specification for the scripting language ECMAScript. A problem in the ECMAScript (JavaScript) specification of async generators, introduced by a May 2021 spec refactor, may lead to mis-implementation in a way that could present as a security vulnerability, such as type confusion and pointer dereference.

The internal async generator machinery calls regular promise resolver functions on IteratorResult (`{ done, value }`) objects that it creates, assuming that the IteratorResult objects will not be then-ables. Unfortunately, these IteratorResult objects inherit from `Object.prototype`, so these IteratorResult objects can be made then-able, triggering arbitrary behaviour, including re-entering the async generator machinery in a way that violates some internal invariants.

The ECMAScript specification is a living standard and the issue has been addressed at the time of this advisory's public disclosure. JavaScript engine implementors should refer to the latest specification and update their implementations to comply with the `AsyncGenerator` section.

 changedetection.io is an open source tool designed to monitor websites for content changes. In affected versions the API endpoint `/api/v1/watch/<uuid>/history` can be accessed by any unauthorized user. As a result any unauthorized user can check one's watch history. However, because unauthorized party first needs to know a watch UUID, and the watch history endpoint itself returns only paths to the snapshot on the server, an impact on users' data privacy is minimal. This issue has been addressed in version 0.45.13. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

In 'hci_conn_del_sysfs()', 'device_unregister()' may be called when
an underlying (kobject) reference counter is greater than 1. This
means that reparenting (happened when the device is actually freed)
is delayed and, during that delay, parent controller device (hciX)

"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: pciehp: Fix infinite loop in IRQ handler upon power fault

The Power Fault Detected bit in the Slot Status register differs from
all other hotplug events in that it is sticky:  It can only be cleared
after turning off slot power.  Per PCIe r5.0, sec. 6.7.1.8:

  If a power controller detects a main power fault on the hot-plug slot,
  it must automatically set its internal main power fault latch [...].
  The main power fault latch is cleared when software turns off power to
  the hot-plug slot.

The stickiness used to cause interrupt storms and infinite loops which
were fixed in 2009 by commits 5651c48cfafe (""PCI pciehp: fix power fault
interrupt storm problem"") and 99f0169c17f3 (""PCI: pciehp: enable
software notification on empty slots"").

Unfortunately in 2020 the infinite loop issue was inadvertently
reintroduced by commit 8edf5332c393 (""PCI: pciehp: Fix MSI interrupt
race""):  The hardirq handler pciehp_isr() clears the PFD bit until
pciehp's power_fault_detected flag is set.  That happens in the IRQ
thread pciehp_ist(), which never learns of the event because the hardirq
handler is stuck in an infinite loop.  Fix by setting the
power_fault_detected flag already in the hardirq handler."	"You are a cybersecurity expert specializing in cyber threat intelligence. Analyze the following CVE

CVE Description:In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block, bfq: fix bfqq uaf in bfq_limit_depth()

Set new allocated bfqq to bic or remove freed bfqq from bic are both
protected by bfqd->lock, however bfq_limit_depth() is deferencing bfqq
from bic without the lock, this can lead to UAF if the io_context is
shared by multiple tasks.

For example, test bfq with io_uring can trigger following UAF in v6.6:

Envoy is a cloud-native, open source edge and service proxy. The HTTP/2 protocol stack in Envoy versions prior to 1.29.3, 1.28.2, 1.27.4, and 1.26.8 are vulnerable to CPU exhaustion due to flood of CONTINUATION frames. Envoy's HTTP/2 codec allows the client to send an unlimited number of CONTINUATION frames even after exceeding Envoy's header map limits. This allows an attacker to send a sequence of CONTINUATION frames without the END_HEADERS bit set causing CPU utilization, consuming approximately 1 core per 300Mbit/s of traffic and culminating in denial of service through CPU exhaustion. Users should upgrade to version 1.29.3, 1.28.2, 1.27.4, or 1.26.8 to mitigate the effects of the CONTINUATION flood. As a workaround, disable HTTP/2 protocol for downstream connections.

"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pid: take a reference when initializing `cad_pid`

During boot, kernel_init_freeable() initializes `cad_pid` to the init
task's struct pid.  Later on, we may change `cad_pid` via a sysctl, and
when this happens proc_do_cad_pid() will increment the refcount on the
new pid via get_pid(), and will decrement the refcount on the old pid
via put_pid().  As we never called get_pid() when we initialized
`cad_pid`, we decrement a reference we never incremented, can therefore
free the init task's struct pid early.  As there can be dangling
references to the struct pid, we can later encounter a use-after-free
(e.g.  when delivering signals).

This was spotted when fuzzing v5.13-rc3 with Syzkaller, but seems to
have been around since the conversion of `cad_pid` to struct pid in
commit 9ec52099e4b8 (""[PATCH] replace cad_pid by a struct pid"") from the
pre-KASAN stone age of v2.6.19.

Fix this by getting a reference to the init task's struct pid when we
assign it to `cad_pid`.
