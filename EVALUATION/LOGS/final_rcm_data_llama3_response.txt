CWE-120

#####3#####
Based on the CVE description, I map it to CWE-416: Use After Free.

The vulnerability occurs when xennet_destroy_queues() is called from xennet_remove(), but real_num_tx_queues has already been set to 0 by unregister_netdev(). This results in kfree-ing queues that are still linked in napi, ultimately causing a crash. The issue arises because the queue destruction function relies on real_num_tx_queues being non-zero before it can safely delete the queues.

The fix involves calling xennet_destroy_queues() from xennet_uninit(), ensuring that queues are destroyed when real_num_tx_queues is set to 0, regardless of how unregister_netdev() was called. This prevents the use-after-free vulnerability by ensuring that queues are properly cleaned up before they can be accessed again.

CWE-416: Use After Free

CWE-79

#####93#####
Based on the CVE description, I map this vulnerability to CWE-416: Use After Free.

The justification for my choice is that the vulnerability involves a use-after-free scenario. When a netdev with active TLS offload goes down, the tls_device_down function is called to stop the offload and tear down the TLS context. However, the socket stays alive, and it still points to the TLS context, which has already been deallocated. This leads to a use-after-free of the TLS context when the netdev goes up again and data flow resumes after TCP retransmissions.

CWE-416: Use After Free

CWE: 89

#####124#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-20: Input Validation Error.

The justification for my choice is that the vulnerability arises from insufficient validation of user-supplied input for the "Identity" parameter under Remote endpoint settings at the web interface. This allows a remote attacker to supply specially crafted input and exploit the vulnerability, which could lead to stored XSS attacks. The CWE-20 category specifically covers issues related to inadequate or missing input validation, which is the root cause of this vulnerability.

CWE-20

#####125#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-94: Code Injection.

The justification for this mapping is that the vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the ASD com.rocks.video.downloader application. This is a classic example of code injection, where an attacker can execute malicious code by injecting it into the target system or application. In this case, the attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code via the MainBrowserActivity component, which is a critical functionality that allows the attacker to take control of the application.

CWE-94

#####126#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-125: Out-of-Bounds Read.

The justification for my choice is as follows:

* The CVE description mentions an "out-of-bounds read" vulnerability in the user mode layer of the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows.
* This type of vulnerability typically falls under the category of out-of-bounds reads, which are a type of memory corruption vulnerability (CWE-125).
* The potential impact of this vulnerability includes code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering, all of which are consistent with the types of attacks that can be facilitated by an out-of-bounds read.

Therefore, I conclude that CWE-125: Out-of-Bounds Read is the most appropriate mapping for this CVE.

#####127#####
Based on the CVE description, I map it to CWE-20: Improper Input Validation.

Justification:

The bug in Authentik's implementation of PKCE allows an attacker to remove the code_challenge parameter from the authorization request, which is a form of input validation failure.

* The vulnerability requires authentication, which suggests that the attack is targeted at authenticated users rather than unauthenticated ones.
* The fact that the vulnerability can be exploited via a POST request to /profile/updateProfile via specific parameters (slackid or phone) suggests that the vulnerability is related to the storage and retrieval of user data.

CWE-94

#####131#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map this vulnerability to CWE-93: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

The justification for my choice is that the vulnerability described in the CVE allows an attacker to trick a site administrator into performing an unintended action (installing and activating the SendWP plugin) by submitting a forged request. This is a classic example of a CSRF attack, which relies on the victim's browser sending a request to the vulnerable web application without their knowledge or consent.

CWE-93

#####132#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-400: Use of Hard-Coded Credentials.

The description mentions that an attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by exploiting a memory allocation issue in FreeImage 3.18.0. This suggests that the vulnerability is related to the way memory is allocated and managed, rather than a specific coding error or flaw.

CWE-400: Use of Hard-Coded Credentials is a good fit because it involves an excessive size value being used for memory allocation, which can lead to a denial-of-service condition. The fact that attackers can exploit this issue to cause a DoS suggests that the vulnerability is related to the way memory is managed, rather than a specific coding error or flaw.

CWE-400

#####133#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-22: Path Traversal.

This suggests that the vulnerability allows an attacker to access or manipulate files outside of the intended scope, which is a characteristic of path traversal attacks. CWE-22 specifically covers this type of attack, where an attacker attempts to access or modify files by manipulating the file system's directory structure.

CWE-22

#####135#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-264: Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer.

The justification for this mapping is as follows:

* The vulnerability allows a user to run a slash command in a channel they are not a member of, which suggests that there is an issue with access control or permission enforcement.
* The description mentions linking a playbook run to a channel and running a slash command as a playbook task command, which implies that the vulnerability is related to the improper execution of code or commands within a specific context (i.e., a channel).
* CWE-264 specifically deals with situations where an attacker can manipulate memory buffers or execute code in a way that bypasses intended access controls. In this case, the attacker can run a slash command in a channel they are not supposed to have access to, which is similar to manipulating memory buffers or executing code outside of its intended scope.

CWE-264

#####136#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-22: Path Traversal.

The justification for this mapping is as follows:

CWE: 94

#####138#####
Based on the provided CVE description, I would map it to CWE-78: Improper Input Validation.

Justification:

The vulnerability is described as a "Remote Code Execution" issue in Microsoft Office, which suggests that an attacker can execute arbitrary code remotely. This type of vulnerability often arises from improper input validation, where user-input data is not properly sanitized or validated before being processed by the system. In this case, it's likely that the vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the system through some form of user-input (e.g., a file upload, a URL parameter, etc.). The lack of proper input validation would allow this injected code to be executed, leading to remote code execution.

CWE-78

#####139#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-285: Authentication Bypass.

The description mentions a "Missing Authorization" vulnerability, which suggests that an attacker can bypass authentication mechanisms and access unauthorized resources or data. This is consistent with the definition of CWE-285, which describes an attack where an attacker can gain unauthorized access to a system or resource without providing valid credentials.

Justification: The CVE description specifically highlights the lack of authorization checks, indicating that an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access. This aligns with the characteristics of CWE-285, making it a suitable mapping.

This type of attack is a classic example of code injection, where an attacker injects malicious code into a system or application. The fact that it's possible to initiate the attack remotely and the complexity of the attack being high also supports this mapping.

CWE-94

#####141#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-22: Path Traversal.

The justification for this mapping is as follows:

* The CVE description mentions "Path traversal" which is a clear indication that the vulnerability allows an attacker to navigate through the file system and potentially access or modify sensitive files.
* The fact that it's mentioned as a potential means of "escalation of privilege via local access" further supports the idea that this is a path traversal vulnerability, as it allows an authenticated user to gain unauthorized access to sensitive areas of the system.

CWE-22

#####142#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery.

Justification:

The CVE description specifically mentions a CSRF vulnerability in Pligg CMS v2.0.2, which is a type of attack where an attacker tricks a user into performing unintended actions on a web application that the user is authenticated with. The fact that it's mentioned as being exploitable via /admin/admin_editor.php suggests that the vulnerability is related to the administration interface, which further supports the CWE-352 classification.

CWE-352

#####143#####
Based on the provided CVE description, I would map it to CWE-416: Use of Hard-Coded Credentials.

The vulnerability is described as a "Remote Code Execution" issue in Windows rndismp6.sys, which suggests that an attacker can execute arbitrary code remotely. This type of vulnerability often involves the use of hard-coded credentials or other sensitive information that can be exploited by an attacker.

In this case, I believe the vulnerability is related to CWE-416 because it likely involves some form of hardcoded or default credential that can be used to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code. The fact that it's a remote code execution vulnerability also suggests that an attacker may be able to exploit this issue without having physical access to the system.

CWE-416

#####144#####
Based on the CVE description, I map it to CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference.

The justification is that the vulnerability is caused by a null pointer dereference, specifically when `pdata->core_data[indx]` is already NULL and has been kfreed. The kernel attempts to pass this null pointer to `sysfs_remove_group()`, which results in a crash. By checking for NULL before removing sysfs attributes, the vulnerability can be mitigated.

CWE-476

#####145#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map this vulnerability to CWE-22: Path Traversal.

The justification for my choice is that the missing capability check in the wprss_ajax_send_premium_support function allows authenticated attackers with Subscriber-level access and above to manipulate the subject line and email address of premium support requests. This can be seen as a form of path traversal, where an attacker can navigate through the system's functionality to reach a sensitive area (in this case, the support system) and manipulate its behavior.

CWE-22

#####146#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-20: Information Exposure Through an Externally-Controlled Input.

The justification for this mapping is that the issue involves the unexpected unlocking of Locked Notes content, which suggests that there was a flaw in the state management of the notes' locking mechanism. This flaw allowed external input (e.g., user interaction or environmental factors) to control the state of the locked notes, resulting in unintended information exposure.

CWE-20:

#####147#####
Based on the CVE description, I map it to CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Path to a Restricted Directory or Improved.

Justification:

The vulnerability is related to an unexpected change in behavior due to an upgrade (JupyterHub 5.0). Prior to this version, the `allow_all` configuration did not take precedence over `identity_provider`, but after the upgrade, it does. This means that all users will be allowed to login regardless of the `identity_provider`, effectively bypassing the intended security restriction.

The CWE-22 category is suitable because it involves an improper limitation of a path (in this case, the configuration) to a restricted directory or improved (the unintended change in behavior). The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to the system, which is a common characteristic of CWE-22 vulnerabilities.

CWE-22

#####148#####
Based on the CVE description, I map it to CWE-20: Improper Input Handling.

Justification:

The vulnerability is caused by an overflow in the module alias name, which exceeds the maximum allowed length of 20 characters including the trailing NUL byte. This is a classic example of improper input handling, where the sof_nau8825.c file provides an invalid or malformed input (the long module alias name) that causes the kernel to produce an error message.

CWE-20:

#####149#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-89: Improper Input Validation.

The justification for this mapping is that the vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious input (in this case, SQL code) into the system, which can then be used to gain unauthorized access to the database. This is a classic example of an SQL injection attack, which is a type of input validation failure.

CWE-89:

#####150#####
Based on the CVE description, I map it to CWE-120: Buffer Copy Without Checking Size of Input (aka "Buffer Overflow").

The justification for my choice is that the vulnerability allows an attacker to read past the end of an allocated buffer, which is a classic symptom of a buffer overflow attack. The fact that the parsing of DXF files is affected and user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability further supports this mapping.

CWE-120

#####151#####
Based on the CVE description, I map it to CWE-20: Input Validation, Sanitization, and Escaping.

Justification:

The vulnerability is caused by a lack of URL encoding in the Oceanic library's handling of user input. This allows an attacker to craft malicious URLs that can manipulate the library's behavior, such as deleting a channel instead of removing a ban. The issue is resolved by fixing the normalization process to properly encode user input.

CWE-20:

#####152#####

CWE-476

#####157#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-693: Information Leak.

The justification for this mapping is that the vulnerability allows an attacker to gather information about which external protocol handlers are functional on a user's system by monitoring the time certain operations take. This is an example of an information leak, where sensitive or potentially sensitive data (in this case, the presence or absence of specific protocol handlers) is inadvertently disclosed.

CWE-693

#####158#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-118: Path Traversal.

The justification for my choice is as follows:

* The vulnerability allows an attacker to write data outside the intended range (out-of-bounds write), which is a characteristic of path traversal attacks.
* The attack requires user interaction in that a victim must open a malicious file, which suggests that the vulnerability can be exploited through a file-based attack vector. This is consistent with the CWE-118 category, which involves manipulating file paths or names to access unauthorized files or directories.

CWE-118

#####159#####
Based on the CVE description, I map it to CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type.

Justification:

The vulnerability allows a high-privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Banking Liquidity Management.

The parserDirectives function is specifically mentioned as being vulnerable to this type of attack, which suggests that it is not properly handling resource-intensive inputs.

CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption

#####161#####
Based on the CVE description, I map it to CWE-366: Use of Incorrect Locking.

Justification:

The vulnerability is a deadlock caused by incorrect locking in the Linux kernel's btrfs file system. The issue arises when the extent lock is held for an entire range while performing fiemap operations, which can lead to pagefaults and deadlocks. The patch resolves this issue by not taking the extent lock for the entire duration of the fiemap operation, as it is safe to do so due to the tracking of the current offset in the tree.

CWE-366: Use of Incorrect Locking

#####162#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery.

Justification:

The CVE description mentions a CSRF vulnerability in Pligg CMS v2.0.2, specifically in the "/admin/admin_log.php?clear=1" endpoint. This is a classic example of a CSRF attack, where an attacker tricks a user into performing an unintended action on their behalf. The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the user's session and perform actions without their knowledge or consent.

CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery

#####163#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-798: Use of Hard-Coded Credentials.

The justification for this mapping is as follows:

* The vulnerability allows an attacker to conduct a brute-force attack against legitimate user passwords, which suggests that the system does not have adequate controls in place to prevent excessive failed authentication attempts.
* The fact that the API-based login lacks restrictions on the number of failed authentication attempts implies that the system relies on hard-coded credentials or default settings, rather than implementing more robust authentication mechanisms.

CWE-798

#####164#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input (aka "Buffer Overflow").

The justification for my choice is as follows:

* The CVE description mentions a buffer overflow in libsoup, which suggests that there is an issue with copying data into a buffer without properly checking its size.
* The description also mentions that the vulnerability can be reached remotely via soup_message_headers_get_content_type, which implies that an attacker could potentially manipulate the input to cause the buffer overflow.

Therefore, I believe that CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input is the most appropriate mapping for this CVE.

This allows an attacker to inject malicious code (in this case, a reflected cross-site scripting attack) which could be used against high privilege users such as admin. CWE-79 specifically covers vulnerabilities related to improper input validation, which is exactly what's happening here.

CWE-79

#####249#####
Based on the CVE description, I map it to CWE-20: Improper Input Validation.

Justification:

The vulnerability arises from a malicious actor sending an IEEE 802.15.4 packet with spoofed length byte and optionally spoofed FCS, which causes the receiver (CC2538) to enter an endless loop. The issue is that the receiver checks for the location of the CRC bit using the packet length byte by considering all 8 bits, instead of discarding bit 7, which is what the radio does. This allows the malicious actor to manipulate the packet length and cause the receiver to read outside of the RX FIFO.

The CWE-20 classification is appropriate because it involves improper input validation, specifically in this case, the validation of the packet length byte. The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malformed packet that takes advantage of the incorrect validation, leading to an endless loop.

CWE-20

Based on the CVE description, I map it to CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Allocation.

The justification for my choice is that the vulnerability occurs when there is a pending RX interrupt before the call to request_irq(RX IRQ) executes. This leads to an immediate firing of the RX IRQ handler after the request_irq() completes, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference and a kernel panic. The issue is related to improper handling of memory allocation and operations within its bounds, which is the essence of CWE-119.

CWE-119

#####405#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-287: Improper Authentication.

The justification for my choice is that the vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication altogether, without providing proper credentials. This is a classic example of an improper authentication issue, where the system fails to verify the identity of the user or device attempting to access the system. The fact that a crafted XML element can cause authentication to succeed without proper credentials further supports this mapping.

CWE-287

#####406#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer.

The justification for this mapping is as follows:

* The CVE description mentions a "stack overflow" vulnerability, which suggests that there is an issue with memory buffer management.
* The specific location of the vulnerability is in the "page parameter from fromAddressNat function", which implies that the problem lies within the bounds of a memory buffer (in this case, the stack).

The lack of CSRF protection in the plugin's login functionality makes it vulnerable to this type of attack.

CWE-93

#####427#####
Based on the CVE description, I map it to CWE-416: Use After Free.

Justification:

The vulnerability occurs when a TMF sas_task is aborted before handling IO completion in mpi_ssp_completion(). The task is freed in pm8001_exec_internal_tmf_task(), but if the I/O completion occurs later, the I/O completion handler still thinks the sas_task is available. This indicates that the memory allocated for the sas_task has been freed, making it vulnerable to use-after-free attacks.

CWE-416: Use After Free

#####428#####
Based on the CVE description, I map it to CWE-89: Improper Input Validation.

The justification for this mapping is as follows:

* The vulnerability is caused by a null pointer dereference in the Linux kernel's SCSI driver (qla2xxx).
* The issue occurs when the system is under memory stress and the driver is unable to allocate an SRB to carry out error recovery of a cable pull.
* As a result, the failure to flush causes upper layers to start modifying scsi_cmnd, which leads to a null pointer access when attempting to DMA unmap the SGL.

CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference

#####442#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption.

The justification for my choice is that the vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, which is a type of uncontrolled resource consumption. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability to consume system resources in an unintended way, causing the system to become unavailable or crash.

CWE: 120

#####471#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-20: Improper Input Handling.

The issue described is that the XML_StopParser function can stop or suspend an unstarted parser, which leads to a crash within the XML_ResumeParser function. This suggests that there is a problem with handling input (in this case, XML data) in a way that causes the program to crash. The fact that the parser has not been started yet implies that the issue is related to improper handling of input before it's even processed.

CWE-20:

#####472#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map this vulnerability to CWE-264: Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer.

The justification for this mapping is as follows:

The justification for my choice is as follows:

* The vulnerability is described as a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack, which typically occurs when unvalidated or unsanitized user input is stored and later executed by the application.
* The description mentions that the issue arises from "insufficient input sanitization and output escaping", which suggests that the plugin does not properly validate or sanitize user input before storing it.
* As a result, an authenticated attacker with sufficient privileges can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages, which will execute when accessed by other users.

CWE-79:

#####486#####
Based on the CVE description, I map it to CWE-20: Improper Input Validation.

Justification:

The vulnerability occurs because an untrusted amount of memory can be allocated by any unauthenticated user, allowing them to cause a process to OOM (out-of-memory) condition. This is due to the fact that the 4-byte length field in the SSH packet is entirely untrusted and can be set to any value by the client. The russh server allocates memory based on this unvalidated input, leading to the vulnerability.

CWE-20:

#####487#####
Based on the CVE description, I map it to CWE-416: Use After Free.

The justification for this mapping is that the vulnerability arises from the tasklet callback function potentially freeing the structure containing the tasklet, which can lead to memory corruption when tasklet_unlock tries to access the freed memory.

The justification for this mapping is as follows:

* The vulnerability is related to memory management, specifically a "double free" issue in the error handling logic of the Atlantic network driver.
* The issue arises when the system is under stress and experiences memory allocation errors, causing the ring data allocation/free functions (aq_ring_free) to be called multiple times on the same ring.
* This leads to incorrect assumptions about the state of the ring pointer, which is used as an indicator of failure. However, this assumption is flawed because only the ring data is allocated/deallocated, not the ring itself.
* The fix involves changing the ring allocation functions to return error codes directly, simplifying error handling and eliminating unnecessary calls to aq_ring_free.

CWE-416: Use After Free

#####493#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-92: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

Justification:

CWE-120

#####711#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-611: Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Allocation.

The justification for this mapping is that the vulnerability arises from an improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory allocation. Specifically, the clock controller's prepare callback grabs the prepare_lock mutex and then performs an I2C access, which resumes the I2C bus controller via its runtime_resume callback. This creates a deadlock situation because the clock controller attempts to grab the prepare_lock mutex again, causing a lock contention.

The vulnerability is related to memory allocation and locking mechanisms, as it involves the use of mutexes (prepare_lock) and callbacks (.runtime_resume). The issue can be resolved by using simple clk_enable()/clk_disable() calls instead of preparing and unpreparing the clock on runtime suspend and resume, which avoids hitting the prepare_lock mutex.

CWE-611

#####712#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-78: Improper Input Validation.

* The vulnerability allows an attacker to embed "malicious script" in a way that enables Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting). This suggests that the issue lies in the plugin's handling of user-input data, specifically in its failure to properly validate or sanitize user-submitted content.
* The fact that this vulnerability can be exploited by embedding malicious script on behalf of the editor implies that the attacker is able to inject arbitrary code into the system, which further supports the notion that the issue is related to input validation.

CWE-94

#####721#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-476 (NULL Pointer Dereferences).

The justification for this mapping is that the vulnerability involves null pointer dereferences in the ice_ptp.c file of the Linux kernel. The devm_kasprintf() function returns a pointer to dynamically allocated memory which can be NULL upon failure, and the code does not properly handle this possibility, leading to null pointer dereferences.

CWE-125

#####725#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-22: Path Traversal.

The justification for this mapping is that the vulnerability is specifically described as an "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')". This matches the definition of CWE-22, which describes a path traversal attack as one where an attacker can manipulate the input to include or traverse directories outside of the intended scope. In this case, the vulnerability allows for PHP Local File Inclusion, which is a classic example of a path traversal attack.

CWE-22

#####726#####
Based on the CVE description, I map it to CWE-22: Path Traversal.

CWE-269

#####728#####
Based on the CVE description, I map it to CWE-94: Code Injection.

Justification:

The vulnerability arises from the insecure handling of user input (`github.head_ref`) used to construct a command for installing a software package. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code by creating a branch with a malicious payload as the name and opening a pull request. The successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution within the context of the GitHub Actions runner, which is a classic example of code injection.

CWE-94

#####729#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-94: Improper Input Validation.

Justification:

The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the system by exploiting the lack of sanitization and escaping of some Filters settings.

CWE-532

#####733#####
Based on the CVE description, I map it to CWE-20: Improper Input Validation.

Justification:

The vulnerability is caused by an accounting issue in the Linux kernel's binder module, where the async_free_space was not updated correctly when handling small asynchronous transactions (less than 8 bytes). This resulted in up to 8 bytes of async_free_space being leaked. The fix involves using the correct buffer size ("buffer_size") instead of the logical buffer size ("size") when updating async_free_space during the free operation.

The CWE-20 classification is appropriate because the vulnerability arises from an improper input validation issue, specifically the failure to properly validate or sanitize the input (in this case, the size of the asynchronous transaction) before processing it.

#####734#####

CWE-120

#####779#####
Based on the CVE description, I map it to CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference.

The justification for my choice is that the vulnerability is a null pointer dereference, which occurs when the code attempts to access memory through a null or dangling pointer. In this case, the issue arises from the failure of the `probe()` function in the `phy_attach_direct()` routine, which causes the `dev->driver` pointer to remain null. Later, during device removal, this null pointer is dereferenced, leading to a kernel NULL pointer dereference.

CWE-476

#####780#####
Based on the CVE description, I map it to CWE-476: Use of Incorrectly Impersonated Object in Another Object's Method or Operation.

The justification for this mapping is that the issue arises from the mis-implementation of async generators in JavaScript, which allows IteratorResult objects to be made then-able and potentially re-enter the async generator machinery. This can lead to type confusion and pointer dereference, which are both indicative of incorrect object impersonation. The vulnerability is not a traditional buffer overflow or SQL injection attack, but rather an issue with the way objects interact with each other in JavaScript.

CWE-476

#####781#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-693: Improper Locking.

* The 'accordion_content_source' attribute is mentioned as being vulnerable to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping, indicating that the plugin does not properly validate or sanitize user-input data before storing it.
* As a result, an authenticated attacker with contributor-level access can inject arbitrary web scripts into pages, which will execute when accessed by other users.

Therefore, I believe this vulnerability falls under CWE-79: Improper Input Validation, as it is related to the failure of the plugin to properly validate or sanitize user-input data before storing it.

#####880#####
Based on the CVE description, I map it to CWE-416: Use After Free.

Justification:

The vulnerability is described as a "use-after-free" issue in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth device handling code. The bug occurs when the `device_unregister()` function is called while there are still outstanding references to the device (i.e., the underlying kobject reference counter is greater than 1). This can cause a dangling pointer to be created, leading to undefined behavior.

The CVE description highlights that reparenting the device to NULL explicitly avoids this scenario. This suggests that the vulnerability arises from attempting to access or manipulate memory after it has been freed, which is a classic characteristic of use-after-free vulnerabilities.

CWE-416: Use After Free

The justification for this mapping is that the vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue, which occurs when an attacker injects malicious code into a web page. The fact that the vulnerability affects the "Web Page Generation" process and allows for Stored XSS further supports the CWE-79 classification.

#####912#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-325: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource.

The justification is as follows:

* The vulnerability is related to the default PSKs (Pre-Shared Keys) generated by Hitron CODA devices.
* These PSKs are generated from 5-digit hex values concatenated with a "Hitron" substring, which results in insufficient entropy.
* This means that an attacker can potentially guess or brute-force the PSK, compromising the security of the device and its connected systems.

The CWE-325 category is relevant because it involves incorrect permission assignment for a critical resource (in this case, the default PSK). The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to the device's cryptographic key, which is a critical resource that should be properly secured.

CWE-79

#####942#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection').

Justification:

The vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to embed untrusted style information into comments, which can result in data exfiltration and potentially lead to CSRF attacks. This is a classic example of code injection, where an attacker injects malicious code (in this case, CSS) into the system without proper validation or sanitization. The fact that the vulnerability allows for the embedding of untrusted style information into comments further supports the mapping to CWE-94.

CWE-94

#####943#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

Justification:

The CVE description explicitly mentions a "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability", which is a well-known type of web-based attack. CSRF attacks occur when an attacker tricks a user into performing unintended actions on a web application, typically by exploiting the trust that users have in certain websites or services.

In this case, the vulnerability affects Page Restrict, a specific software component, and the description mentions no other types of vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, SQL injection). Given the explicit mention of CSRF, I believe CWE-352 is the most accurate mapping.

CWE: 352

#####944#####
Based on the CVE description, I map it to CWE-416: Use After Free.

The vulnerability is described as a use-after-free (UAF) issue in the Linux kernel's block subsystem. The bug occurs when the `bfq_limit_depth()` function is called without holding the `bfqd->lock` lock, which can lead to UAF if the io_context is shared by multiple tasks. This is because the function deferences a `bfqq` from the `bic` list without protecting it with the lock.

The fix for this issue involves protecting the `bic_to_bfqq()` function with the `bfqd->lock` lock, which ensures that the `bfqq` is not accessed after it has been freed. This prevents the use-after-free vulnerability and ensures the integrity of the kernel's block subsystem.

CWE-416

#####945#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-94: Cross-Site Request Forgery.

Based on the CVE description, I map it to CWE-416: Use After Free.

The justification for this mapping is as follows:

* The vulnerability occurs when the `cad_pid` is initialized without taking a reference, and later changed via sysctl. This leads to a use-after-free scenario where the old pid's struct is freed early, leaving dangling references.
* The bug is triggered by delivering signals, which suggests that the issue is related to the use of memory after it has been freed.
* The KASAN splat provided in the CVE description shows a read access to memory at an address that was previously freed, which further supports the mapping to CWE-416.

CWE-416

#####982#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map this vulnerability to CWE-94: Improper Input Validation.

Justification:

The description mentions a "Remote Code Execution" vulnerability in Microsoft's Speech Application Programming Interface (SAPI), which suggests that an attacker can inject malicious code into the system.

CWE-384

#####987#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map this vulnerability to CWE-287: Improper Authentication.

The justification for this mapping is as follows:

* The vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to log in as registered users, including administrators, by exploiting the lack of proper verification of a user's identity.
* This is a classic example of an authentication bypass vulnerability, where an attacker can gain unauthorized access to a system or application without providing valid credentials.

CWE-287: Improper Authentication

#####988#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-79: Improper Input Validation.

The justification for this mapping is as follows:

* The vulnerability is described as "Multiple stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities", which indicates that the issue is related to the injection of malicious code into a web application.
* The attack vector involves injecting crafted payloads into the "id" or "name" parameter, which suggests that the vulnerability is related to improper input validation.
* CWE-79 specifically covers issues where an attacker can inject malicious data into a system through an input field, and the system does not properly validate or sanitize that input.

Therefore, the correct mapping is:

CWE-79

#####989#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-121: Stack-Based Buffer Overflow.

The justification for this mapping is as follows:

* The CVE description mentions a "stack overflow" vulnerability, which is a classic symptom of a stack-based buffer overflow.
* The vulnerability occurs in the `schedEndTime` parameter of the `setSchedWifi` function, suggesting that there is an issue with the way the function handles input data.
* A stack-based buffer overflow typically occurs when an application writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, causing the buffer to spill over onto the stack and potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.

Therefore, I believe that CWE-121: Stack-Based Buffer Overflow is the most appropriate mapping for this CVE.

#####990#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

Justification:

The CVE description mentions that the manipulation leads to cross-site request forgery, which is a type of attack where an attacker tricks a user into performing unintended actions on a web application. This matches the definition of CSRF in CWE-352. Additionally, the fact that it's possible to initiate the attack remotely and that the exploit has been disclosed to the public further supports the mapping to CWE-352.

CWE-352

This type of vulnerability is a classic example of CWE-79, where the input provided by the user is not properly sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.

CWE-79

#####992#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-79: Improper Input Validation.

The justification for my choice is that the vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious code (cross-site scripting) by manipulating the "page" argument in the "/view/student_exam_mark_insert_form1.php" file. This suggests a lack of proper input validation, which is a common weakness exploited by attackers. The fact that the attack can be initiated remotely and the exploit has been disclosed to the public further supports this mapping.

CWE-79

#####993#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-79: Improper Input Validation.

The justification for this mapping is as follows:

* The vulnerability is described as a "reflected" XSS, which suggests that the issue lies in the handling of user-input data.
* The attack vector involves the login page, implying that the vulnerability is related to the processing of user input (e.g., username and password) on this page.
* CWE-79 specifically covers issues where an application fails to properly validate or sanitize user-input data, leading to a security vulnerability.

CWE-79

#####994#####
Based on the CVE description, I map it to CWE-416: Use After Free.

The vulnerability is described as a use-after-free (UAF) issue in the Linux kernel's SUNRPC module. The bug occurs when a listener svc_sock is freed before invoking svc_tcp_accept() for an established child sock. This creates a window where the newsock retains a freed listener svc_sock in sk_user_data, which can lead to a use-after-free report in svc_tcp_listen_data_ready(). The KASAN report shows that the freed memory is being accessed again, leading to a slab-use-after-free error.

The fix for this issue is to simply do nothing in svc_tcp_listen_data_ready() if the state is not TCP_LISTEN, which avoids dereferencing svsk for all child sockets. This indicates that the vulnerability is related to using freed memory after it has been deallocated, which is a classic characteristic of use-after-free errors.

CWE-416

#####995#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-78: Improper Handling of Insufficiently Random Values.

The justification for my choice is as follows:

* The issue allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands with root-level permissions, which indicates a lack of proper handling of insufficiently random values (i.e., default and easily guessable credentials).
* The fact that the TELNET service is enabled by default with admin/admin as default credentials suggests that the device does not generate sufficiently random values for authentication.
* This vulnerability can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the device, which aligns with the definition of CWE-78.

CWE-78

#####996#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management.

The justification for my choice is that the vulnerability allows an attacker to escalate privileges from a low-privileged state to a higher-privileged state (SYSTEM), which is a classic example of privilege escalation. The fact that the issue exists within the product installer and involves default MySQL credentials further supports this mapping, as it highlights the improper management of privileges during the installation process.

CWE-269

#####997#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

Justification:

The CVE description mentions a vulnerability in Avenwu Whistle v.2.9.90 and earlier versions that allows attackers to perform malicious API calls, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This is a classic characteristic of a CSRF attack, where an attacker tricks a user into performing unintended actions on their behalf.

The CWE-352 definition matches this scenario: "An attacker can cause a web application to perform some action that the attacker is not authorized to perform, such as modifying or deleting data."

Therefore, I conclude that the CVE description maps to CWE-352.

CWE-352

#####998#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-89: Improper Input Validation.

The justification for this mapping is as follows:

* The vulnerability is described as a SQL injection attack, which typically occurs when an application does not properly validate or sanitize user-input data.
* The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands via the username parameter, indicating that the input validation is inadequate.
* Additionally, the fact that some data in the underlying DB is disclosed suggests that the vulnerability allows for unauthorized access to sensitive information.

CWE-89

#####999#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-284: Improper Authorization.

The justification for this mapping is that the vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authorization controls by manipulating a user-controlled key in Metagauss ProfileGrid. This suggests that there is a flaw in the authentication or access control mechanism, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality. The fact that it's described as an "Authorization Bypass" further supports this mapping.

CWE-284

#####1000#####
Based on the CVE description, I would map it to CWE-264: Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls.

The justification for this mapping is that the vulnerability arises from a lack of authorization checks, which allows an attacker with standard user privileges to update the password policy in the platform settings. This indicates a failure to properly enforce permissions, privileges, or access controls, which is the core characteristic of CWE-264.

CWE-264
