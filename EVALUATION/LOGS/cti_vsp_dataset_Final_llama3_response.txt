**Attack Complexity (AC)**: Low (L) - The attack requires minimal complexity, as an attacker can simply inject arbitrary web scripts by tricking a user into performing an action.

**Privileges Required (PR)**: None (N) - No privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability, as it is exploitable by unauthenticated attackers.

**User Interaction (UI)**: Required (R) - The attack requires the attacker to trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

**Scope (S)**: Unchanged (U) - The scope of the impact remains unchanged, as the vulnerability affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected system.

**Confidentiality (C)**: High (H) - The vulnerability allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts, which can lead to sensitive information disclosure or unauthorized access.

**Integrity (I)**: High (H) - The vulnerability also allows attackers to modify the affected system's integrity by injecting malicious code.

**Availability (A)**: High (H) - The vulnerability can also impact the availability of the affected system, as it may cause the system to become unavailable or unstable.

Based on these values, the final CVSS v3.1 vector string is:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Based on the provided CVE description, I will calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score and determine the values for each base metric.

**Attack Vector (AV)**: Network (N) - The issue can be exploited remotely, so it's a network-based attack.

**Attack Complexity (AC)**: Low (L) - The vulnerability is relatively easy to exploit, requiring minimal expertise or resources.

**Privileges Required (PR)**: None (N) - An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability without any privileges.

**User Interaction (UI)**: None (N) - No user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Scope (S)**: Unchanged (U) - The attack only affects the targeted system, with no impact on other systems or data.

**Confidentiality (C)**: High (H) - The sensitive information that can be obtained via the firmware update process has high confidentiality implications.

**Integrity (I)**: None (N) - There is no integrity implication for this vulnerability, as it only affects confidentiality.

**Availability (A)**: None (N) - There is no availability impact for this vulnerability, as it does not affect system functionality or performance.

Based on these values, the final CVSS v3.1 vector string is:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
